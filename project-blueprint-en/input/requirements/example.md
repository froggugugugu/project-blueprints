# We Need a Better Equipment Management System

## Current Problems

- We track equipment inventory in Excel, but we lose track of who has what
- Many people forget to update the ledger when new equipment is purchased
- Physical inventory checks take an entire day every time
- Broken equipment sometimes gets left unaddressed

## What We Want

- Ability to register "I'm borrowing this item" from a smartphone
- A list view showing who currently has what
- Ability to report broken equipment, with notifications sent to administrators
- A checklist that appears during inventory checks would be great
- It would be nice to see how much equipment each department is using

## Users

- General employees (~200 people): Borrow and return equipment
- General Affairs administrators (3 people): Register, dispose of, and inventory equipment
- Department heads (~10 people): View their department's usage status

## Concerns

- Does it need to be accessible from outside the office? Probably internal-only is fine
- We want to migrate data from the existing Excel ledger (~500 records)
- Budget is limited. Ideally it would run on our existing servers
- Barcode or QR code scanning for equipment would be convenient, but not essential

## Priorities

1. First, the ability to manage check-outs and returns (this is our biggest pain point)
2. Next, equipment ledger management (registration, editing, disposal)
3. Inventory check features can come later
4. Reports and analytics are nice-to-have if time permits
