# Data Model

> **This is a template.** It is empty immediately after setup.
> Content is generated by one of the following methods:
> - Auto-generated when schemas are implemented via the `/implementing-features` skill
> - Auto-generated in Phase 4 of the PJM team
>
> **How it's generated**: AI auto-generates this from Zod schema definitions in the codebase.
> Refers to `project-config.md` section 5 (Data Persistence) to maintain consistency with the persistence strategy.
> AI updates this in sync with the implementation when schemas change.

## Schema Location

<!-- e.g., src/shared/types/ -->
<!-- e.g., Form validation at src/infrastructure/validation/schemas.ts -->

## Schema Details

<!-- AI auto-generates and expands from Zod schema definitions in the codebase -->

### [Schema Name]

<!-- Document each schema in the following format -->

| Field | Type | Notes |
| ----- | ---- | ----- |

Derived types: <!-- Create, Update, etc. -->

## Form Validation

<!-- List of form validation schemas -->

| Schema | Target | Key Rules |
| ------ | ------ | --------- |

## Important Validation Rules

<!-- Validation rules detected by AI from the codebase.
     Document business logic constraints (upper limits, uniqueness, range restrictions, etc.) -->

## Utility Functions

<!-- Document utility functions used for data transformation and calculations -->
