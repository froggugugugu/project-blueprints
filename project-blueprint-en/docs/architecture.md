# Architecture

> **This is a template.** It is empty immediately after setup.
> Content is generated by one of the following methods:
> - Auto-generated when the `/architecture` skill is executed
> - Auto-updated when the `/implementing-features` skill is executed
> - Auto-generated in Phase 2 of the PJM team
>
> **How it's generated**: AI initially generates this based on `project-config.md` section 4.
> Subsequent updates are collaboratively maintained by AI and humans as the implementation evolves.
